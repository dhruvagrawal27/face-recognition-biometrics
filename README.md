# Face Recognition System with PCA Analysis

This project implements a face recognition system using the `face_recognition` library and enhances it with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature dimensionality reduction and visualization. The system can detect faces in images, match them against known faces, and provide insights into the facial features through PCA.

## Features

## Implementation Details

### 1. Basic Face Recognition System

#### Setup and Directory Management
```python
def setup_paths(train_dir: str = "./train/", test_image: str = "./test/test.jpg")
```
- Creates necessary directories for training and test images
- Validates path existence
- Returns tuple of paths for further processing

#### Face Loading and Encoding
```python
def load_known_faces(train_dir: str)
```
- Loads images from training directory
- Processes each image to detect faces
- Generates face encodings using face_recognition library
- Returns lists of names and corresponding encodings

#### Image Processing
```python
def process_test_image(image_path: str, known_names: List[str], known_encodings: List[np.ndarray])
```
- Loads test image
- Converts color space from BGR to RGB
- Detects faces in the image
- Compares against known faces
- Draws rectangles and labels around detected faces

### 2. PCA Enhancement

#### Data Standardization
```python
X_std = (X - X.mean(axis=0)) / X.std(axis=0)
```
- Normalizes face data to have zero mean and unit variance
- Ensures all features are on the same scale
- Prepares data for PCA processing

#### PCA Transformation
```python
pca = PCA(n_components=n_components)
X_pca = pca.fit_transform(X_std)
```
- Reduces dimensionality of face data
- Identifies principal components
- Transforms data into new feature space

#### Visualization
- Generates plots for:
  - Explained variance ratio
  - Cumulative explained variance
  - Eigenfaces visualization

## Usage Instructions

1. **Setup Training Data**
   ```bash
   # Place training images in train/ directory
   # Name format: person_name.jpg
   ```

2. **Basic Face Recognition**
   ```bash
   python face_recognition.py
   ```
   - Processes training images

   - Saves and displays results

3. **Face Recognition with PCA**
   ```bash
   python face_recognition_pca.py
   ```
   - Performs basic face recognition
   - Adds PCA analysis
   - Generates visualization plots

## Process Flow

1. **Training Phase**
   - Load training images
   - Detect faces in each image
